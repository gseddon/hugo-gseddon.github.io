At Unihack our team of 3 built a multiplayer, networked version of the classic Asteroids video game, in 24 frantic hours.
We separately implemented a game server in node.js, a game client in paper.js, and framerate independing synchronisation and networking code. This was a massive learning curve for the team, none of whom had touched any of this before, but we came together fantastically as a team and produced one of the most popular programs at the event.
