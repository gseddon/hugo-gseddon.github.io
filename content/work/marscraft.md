At the NASA Spacehack 2016 hackathon, our team of four had the opportunity to make use of a HTC Vive for our project. In keeping with the Space theme, we decided to make a Virtual Reality Mars experience, low gravity and everything. As always, we were diving into the unknown with our tools and frameworks, specifically the Unity game engine and C#, along with alpha quality VR integrations into our engine. However, we successfully bonded over the lack of sleep and free pizza and built the game demonstrated in the video below. Our game Marscraft was a very immersive experience, with a soundtrack based on the Apollo missions. The astronauts appear about 8" tall standing in front of you, and people were seen to physically jump backwards upon turning around and seeing one standing behind them. However, the key learning experience for me was that building games is insanely hard, and I much prefer playing them!
