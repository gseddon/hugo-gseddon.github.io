I volunteered to help an internal team to help interface our IBM Watson Cognitive Computing platform with a NAO humanoid robot. We wrote a node.js server to connect to the Watson Conversation API and provide some structuring, and I wrote python bindings to allow the robot's operating system to interface its speakers and microphones directly to the server, as well as have automated motion in response to classes of words. For example, if it replied to a question with 'yes', it would nod its head. As a result you are able to have a spoken conversation with Watson via the robot! This was used to great success at media events here in Australia, and my manager and I were flown to Vietnam and Singapore for engagements there too, as the robot's sole handler. Here he is seen on national news in Singapore for the opening of IBM's new office in Marina Bay.

 Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Tharman was present and briefly interacted with him. This project was a great success and brought praise from several regional IBM Vice Presidents.
