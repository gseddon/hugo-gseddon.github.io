I have experience working on telco scale big data pipelines, handling upwards of 10k events/second, with an emphasis on extremely high availability. A relentless tinkerer, I love to automate things, whether it's business processes, programming and design tools, or the technology in my home. Experience in a range of sectors, including corporate, start-ups, and academia. Strong believer in continuous self-education, currently learning more about domain driven design and its applications in functional programming paradigms."
